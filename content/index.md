The Psychology of Programming Interest Group (PPIG) will meet from the 7th to the 10th of September 2016, in Cambridge, UK. It will be colocated with [VL/HCC](https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2016/).

Registration can be completed at the St. Catherine's College website [here](https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/vlhcc-and-ppig-2016).

PPIG is interested in psychological issues in programming and software engineering, and more generally, what happens anytime people meet formal structures.

We've covered how people learn mathematical notations, how to make programming more usable, issues in supporting creativity in design and the prospects for live coding laptop music. PPIG supports a correspondingly broad spectrum of research approaches from psychological, philosophical and social theory to quantitative and experience reports.

We'll have keynotes from the excellent [Michael Kolling](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/mik/) and [Kasper Lund](http://verdich.dk/kasper/). 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:workshop@ppig.org?subject=PPIG%202016).

The final timetable will be published shortly on the [program page](../program).
